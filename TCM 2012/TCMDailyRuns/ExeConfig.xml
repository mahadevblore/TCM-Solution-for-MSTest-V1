<!--ExecutorSuite - Use ',' as delimitor for defining suites and ':' as delimitor to split between suites to run in multiple systems
                                                for eg., ExecutorSuite=12636,12634,12757:13265,14258,12345:23475,13451-->
<!--ControllerSuite - Pass the suite/s with delimitor as ',' in order to run tests in the controller machine
        ExecutorSuite - Pass the suite/s with delimitor as ',' to run tests in executor machine
        Order is 0 based indexing
        Type - values of type can only be controller or executor
               Controller is for the machine which is going to collate the results
               Executor is for the machines which is/are going to just run the tests
               
        Typical scenarios
        1. Distribute is false and SuiteID is null : Entire Plan test cases will be pulled and executed
        2. Distribute is false and SuiteID contains values : The Suite/s passed will be pulled and executed
        3. Distribute is true, SplitRun is false and SuiteID is null : Entire plan test cases will be divided by number of systems and based on Order 
                                                                       the test cases will be distributed evenly
        4. Distribute is true, SplitRun is false and SuiteID is not null : The Suite/s will be pulled and test cases will be divided by number of systems and based on Order 
                                                                           the test cases will be distributed evenly
        5. Distribute is true, SplitRun is true (SuiteID will be ignored) : The Controller machine will pick up Suite/s passed in ControllerSuite and 
                                                                            according to number of systems the ExecutorSuite will be split using delimitor
                                                                            ':' and distributed among systems
        Note: By default Controller's Order will be 0 and other respective machines will be ordered starting from 1 to (number of systems -1)-->
