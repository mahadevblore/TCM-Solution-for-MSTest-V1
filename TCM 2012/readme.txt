This is a very simple solution for executing test cases on distributed environment with lots of customization in place.

The XMLs are the main drivers for this solution. Hence, the xml entries must be absolutely spot on.

This is not an out of the box solution. It would require little bit of understanding of how TFS 2015 and below used to run test case
 and publish them to MTM (client for TFS Server).
 
This solution is build for Test Cases written in VS 2012 and works with only TFS 2015 and below for XAML definitions.
